# Secure Computation

A simulation of algorithms used in Reliable Broadcast (RB) and Byzantine Agreement (BA) problems

These are used to communicate data securely over a distributed network

Reliable Brodcast (RB) involves sending a broadcast message in such a way that even if any corrupt parties or byzantine adversaries are present in the network, the honest parties all receive the original message.

Byzantine Agreement (BA) involves many parties starting with inputs of their own choice, but all honest parties ending with the same output, regardless of the existence of corrupt or byzantine adversaries.
