The Phase-King algorithm is used to solve the Byzantine Agreement (BA) problem

The algorithm works for number of parties 'n', number of corruptions 't'

where n > 4t

The algorithm has t+1 phases, each with 2 rounds

Each party initializes their preferred output 'pref_i' to be input bit 'b_i'

In the kth phase,

  A 'king' is chosen for the phase
  
  In round 1 of the phase, every party sends its pref_i to everyone
  
  Of the received pref bits, the majority is assigned to 'v_i' (or default/null value in case of no majority)
  
  In round 2 of the phase, the current 'king' sends its own pref bit to everyone

  If for each party, v_i was received more than t + n/2 times, pref_i is set as v_i

  Else, pref_i is set to the king's pref bit

At the end of t+1 phases, all parties output their pref bit
