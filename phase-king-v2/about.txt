The Modified Phase-King algorithm is used to solve the Byzantine Agreement (BA) problem

The algorithm works for number of parties 'n', number of corruptions 't'

where n > 3t (better corruption toleration than plain Phase-King)

The algorithm has t+1 phases, each with 3 rounds

Each party initializes their preferred output 'pref_i' to be input bit 'b_i'

In the kth phase,

  A 'king' is chosen for the phase
  
  In round 1 of the phase, every party sends its pref_i to everyone
  
  In round 2 of the phase, of each party's received pref bits, if any one bit is received atleast n-t times, it is sent as a proposal to all other parties

  If a proposal for a specific bit is received more than t times, set party's pref bit as proposed bit
  
  In round 3 of the phase, the current 'king' sends its own pref bit to everyone

  If some proposed bit in round 2 was received atleast n-t times, pref_i the proposed bit

  Else, pref_i is set to the king's pref bit

At the end of t+1 phases, all parties output their pref bit
